___1___push_back

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main (){

    // This is how we write a vector, that's the format.
    vector<string> foods= {"apple", "mango"}; // We can do direct initialization like create vector with value already in it.

    foods.push_back("Carrot"); // or we can create an empty vector and then by using push back we can store values into it. 

    cout << foods.at(2); // since it's a list we print out each values by using at function like each index
    // les say in the list, apple is index 0, mango is index 1
    return 0;
}

___2___
Basic with string
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main (){

    // This is how we write a vector, that's the format.
    vector<string> food; // here we are starting with a empty list

food.push_back("Apple"); // by using these we can fill our vector with values
food.push_back("Mango");
food.push_back("Kiwi");

food.push_back("Berry");

food.at(0) = "watermelon"; // here we can update the list
cout << food.at(0);
    return 0;

}

___3___

vector with for loop

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main (){

    // This is how we write a vector, that's the format.
    vector<string> food; // here we are starting with a empty list

food.push_back("Apple"); // by using these we can fill our vector with values
food.push_back("Mango");
food.push_back("Kiwi");

food.push_back("Berry");

food.at(0) = "watermelon";

for(int i = 0; i < food.size(); i++){
    cout << food.at(i) << endl;
}



    return 0;

}

___4___vector with int
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main (){

    
    vector<int> num; // with int values

num.push_back(1); // by using these we can fill our vector with values
num.push_back(2);
num.push_back(3);

num.push_back(4);

num.at(0) = 7;

for(int i = 0; i < num.size(); i++){
    cout << num.at(i) << endl;
}



    return 0;

}


___5___
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main (){

    
    vector<int> num(4); // we can also declare a vector with 4 elements.

num.push_back(1); // by using these we can fill our vector with values
num.push_back(2);
num.push_back(3);

num.push_back(4);

num.at(0) = 7;

for(int i = 0; i < num.size(); i++){
    cout << num.at(i) << endl;
}



    return 0;

}

___6___ initialization first
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main (){
    vector<int> num(4); // we can also declare a vector with 4 elements.

// but each vector element is initialized with the default value of 0.
// But we can always update the value like this

num.at(3) = 5;

cout << num.at(0) << endl;
cout << num.at(1) << endl;
cout << num.at(2) << endl;
cout << num.at(3) << endl; // instead of 0, now it's 5 since we updated 

    return 0;

}
___7___ resize the size of a vector 
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main() {

    vector<int> num(5); // initializing vector with 5 elements, and each of them are 0.
int valDel;
cin >> valDel;
// now we can use the concept of index to update the value from 0 to another value.  
// in the vector it looks like this {12, 13, 5, 20, 21}
num.at(0) = 12;
num.at(1) = 13;
num.at(2) = 5;
num.at(3) = 20;
num.at(4) = 21;
// now we can run a for loop to print values from the vector num
for(int i = 0; i < num.size(); i++){

    cout << num.at(i) << " "; // num.at(i) means num is our vector, at.num(i) where i is 0 right now, print index 0, which is 12. After each iteration, the index will increase
}
cout << endl;

// now we need to resize, means by using an int value, we will delete the size of the vector, like it is 5 right now, then it will be 4

num.resize(num.size() - valDel); // numsize() is 4 right if valDel is 1. Depends on the user, so we updated the size
for(int i = 0; i < num.size(); i++){

    cout << num.at(i) << " "; // num.at(i) means num is our vector, at.num(i) where i is 0 right now, print index 0, which is 12. After each iteration, the index will increase
}

    return 0;
}
___8___ pop_back and back
#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
using namespace std;
int main (){

    // This is how we write a vector, that's the format.
    vector<string> foods= {"apple"}; // has only one element 

foods.pop_back(); // pop back remove the last element, so 0 elements for now

cout << foods.back(); // will print the last element, but since doesn't have anything so print nothing. 
}
