since we have to iterate through each keys to see which one fits, we can declare a boolean value

1. bool firstKey = true; like set it equals to true; and then we will compare it like later one

then we will declare another container which will hold all the our possible keys;

but first we gonna run a loop that goes through each key one by one.
2. for(int k = 0; k < keys.size(); k++){

    // container 
    string currentKey = keys.at(i); // now this have the current key we are testing like when k = 27, current key = ablaze

    // another string container decrypt to store decrypted text for that specific key

    


}
