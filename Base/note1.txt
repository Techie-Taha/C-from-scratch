Way of defining the basic of C++

#include<iostream> 
include namespace std;
int main(){                  Basic way
    cout << "Hello";
    return 0;


}

If we want to add a new line we just gonna do
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "Hello";
    cout << endl; # this endl needs to be written like this, can't be "endl". This endl creates a new line of code
    cout << "Hello world";

    return 0;


  }
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "Hello";
    cout << "\n"; # this \n needs to be written like this, can't be \n. This \n creates a new line of code
    cout << "Hello world";
    we could also do, cout << "Hello\n"; like this

  }

  Or we can write the whole code in one line, we allowed to that as well.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    cout << "Hello world" << endl << "Hello" << "Taha" << "\n"; // don't type cout multiple times.
  } // in the terminal we will see 
Hello world
Hello
Taha
